# NITC Data Structures and Algorithms Lab (S4) Assignments Repository

A brief description of what this project does and who it's for

## Overview

This repository contains implementations of various data structures and algorithms in C, created as assignments for my DSA Lab at NITC (Semester 4) course. Throughout the course, I've implemented multiple algorithms and data structures to solve various problems efficiently.

## Implemented Algorithms and Data Structures

# Graph Algorithms:
        Dijkstra's Algorithm
        Prim's Algorithm
        Kruskal's Algorithm
        Kosaruju's Algorithm
        Warshall's Algorithm
        Depth-First Search (DFS)
        Breadth-First Search (BFS)
        Tarjan's Algorithm for finding bridges and articulation points
        Topological Sort
        Detecting Cycles in a Graph
        +Many More

# Tree Algorithms:
        Red-Black Tree Insertion and Fixup
        AVL Tree Insertion and Deletion
